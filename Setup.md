# Setup

## Requirements

- TYPO3 CMS 8 LTS & 9 LTS

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Enable the users who are allowed to work with the module in the `be_users` table.
3. By default, the tables `fe_users` & be_users` are defined as the one having sensitive information, therefore there is a checkbox to hide this record.
